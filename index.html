							<h2>Start-Up</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Through careful planning on the part of the founders, the start-up costs for Occasions are minimal. It began as a home-based business with little overhead, and it continues to demand fewer outlay of funds as a service-based business.
							The start-up cost investment funds were assets saved from prior earnings by the owners who did event planning on a part-time basis before establishing themselves as a business.
							It is the wish of the founders to remain a debt-free establishment. However, recognizing that in reality not all variables are controllable, outside financing is a viable option. Both founders own homes and have a perfect credit rating.

						<h3>
							Target Market Segment Strategy
						</h3>


						<p> Our target markets are middle to upper-middle class families, couples, individuals, or private and public organizations.
							We chose these groups because they are most able to afford event planners, and have the least amount of time to spare for event planning in general.
							Families demand attention, employees are overburdened, and overwhelming detail needed to plan large events are too large a constraint to place on people not trained in the area of event planning.

							<h2>Sales strategy</h2>

						<p> CRP will for the most part be using the sale strategy of personal selling.
							eunice has formed relationships throughout the business community. eunice will initially leverage these relationships to form some initial clients.
							Once things get rolling and CRP has developed some satisfied clients, eunice will be developing relationships with her network of friends developed .
							Eunice to prospective customers will be based on the high level of service offered and cost advantages by going with CRP. The cost savings can be quantitied and shown to the customer
							while the higher level of service can be guarantee as well as communicated through testimonials from satisfied clients.

						</p>

						<h3>Sales Forecast</h3>
						</header>
						<p> The first month will be spent setting up the office. It is unlikely that there will be any sales activity within the
							first two months. During the first and second month, eunice will be developing systems to provide a template for future
							event planning. Once this is set up, CRP should be able to process the service request rather easily.
							The third month should see the start of sales activity. It will not be until the fifth month that things will really kick in. From month
							six through 12 sales will steadily increase and the increase should continue well into year two
